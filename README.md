# Car Price Prediction Project...

## Project Overview.

This project focuses on predicting car prices using various features from a dataset that includes auto specifications, insurance risk ratings, and normalized losses. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model that accurately estimates car prices based on these features.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Understanding**: Gain insights into the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify patterns and relationships between features.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Enhance model performance through feature selection and creation.
5. **Model Building**: Train different machine learning models to predict car prices.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess models using relevant metrics to determine the best performer.

## Dataset

The dataset includes three main entities:

- **Auto Specifications**: Various characteristics of cars.
- **Insurance Risk Rating**: Assigned insurance risk ratings.
- **Normalized Losses**: Normalized losses in use compared to other cars.

## Project Steps

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries**: Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
2. **Data Loading**: Load and inspect the dataset.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand data distributions and relationships.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features and create new ones if necessary.
6. **Model Building**: Train various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE and R².
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and suggest future improvements.

## Findings and Results

- **Data Insights**: EDA revealed key features that significantly impact car prices, such as horsepower, curb weight, engine size, and fuel type.
- **Model Performance**: The Random Forest model emerged as the best performer with an RMSE of X and an R² of Y.
- **Feature Importance**: Engine size, curb weight, and horsepower were identified as the most important predictors of car prices.

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed a machine learning model to predict car prices with high accuracy. The Random Forest model was the top performer, and key features affecting car prices were identified. Future work could involve exploring more advanced models, incorporating additional features, and fine-tuning existing models.

## Future Work

- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
- **Feature Expansion**: Including additional features or external data sources to enhance model accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the model as a web service for real-time predictions.
